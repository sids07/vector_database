# is usually spread from infected pregnant women to their babies, or from child-to-child contact. It can also be spread through unprotected sex and injecting drugs. 
# Hepatitis B is uncommon in the UK. It most commonly affects people who became infected while growing up in part of the world where the infection is more common, 
# such as southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Most adults infected with hepatitis B are able to fight off the virus and fully recover from the infection within a couple of months. 
# But most people infected as children develop a long-term infection. This is known as chronic hepatitis B, and can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Antiviral medicine can be used to treat it.
# In the UK, vaccination against hepatitis B is recommended for people in high-risk groups, such as: healthcare workers, people who inject drugs, men who have sex with men, 
# children born to mothers with hepatitis B, people travelling to parts of the world where the infection is more common, Hepatitis B vaccination is also part of the routine immunisation 
# programme so all children can benefit from protection from this virus.
